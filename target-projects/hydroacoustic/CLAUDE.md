# CLAUDE.md — 2026 Hydroacoustic Biomass Estimation

*This project was scaffolded from the AgenticEngineering warehouse. The warehouse's own `CLAUDE.md` describes the warehouse, not this project — do not load it as authoritative; this file is.*

## Working approach

State your reading of the task before acting. If the task is ambiguous or underspecified, stop and ask rather than guessing. If multiple approaches exist, present tradeoffs — do not pick silently. For multi-step work, outline a brief plan with verification checks before starting.

**Analyse-first.** This is a research project. The default workflow is to start an investigation (`/start-analysis`), do the work in a dated dir, finalise it (`/finish-analysis`), and let findings settle into `glossary.md`, `docs/domain/`, `docs/adr/`, or `docs/planning/future-work.md`. The build chain is available for shippable artefacts but is not the centre of gravity.

## SharePoint mirror

This project is bidirectionally mirrored to `sharepoint_planning:PROJECTS/2026 Hydroacoustic Biomass Estimation/`. The local directory and the SharePoint folder hold **the same shape**, with one exception: code does not push.

- **At session start:** run `/sharepoint-sync pull`. Newer files on SharePoint come down.
- **At `/finish`:** run `/sharepoint-sync push`. Newer files locally go up.
- **What syncs:** everything not excluded by `.rclone-filter`. Agent infrastructure (`CLAUDE.md`, `glossary.md`, `docs/`, `.tickets/`, `analysis/`) syncs alongside the human-facing dirs (`Articles/`, `Proposal/`, `Data/`, `Reports/`, `Expenses/`). Another agent picking up the SharePoint folder gets the full project context.
- **What does NOT sync:** `src/`, `scripts/`, `output/`, `.git/`, `.venv/`, `.claude/`, `.env`, build artefacts. See `.rclone-filter`.
- **Deletes do not propagate.** `rclone copy --update` only ever transfers — it never removes. To delete a file from the project, you must remove it from **both sides explicitly**. The skill refuses to do deletions; do them by hand and document them in the relevant ticket or INVESTIGATION.

See [`/sharepoint-sync`](.claude/skills/sharepoint-sync/SKILL.md) for full mechanics, conflict behaviour, and recovery.

## What this project is

**WHAT**: Hydroacoustic biomass estimation in MCA pondage, using BioSonics DT-X Extreme echo sounders run by Infofish Australia. Two complementary surveys are planned: a **biomass** survey (down- and side-looking sounder passes; real-time fish detection, counting, and size-grading via BioSonics Auto Track) and a **behaviour** survey (movement patterns relevant to husbandry decisions). Side-scan imaging supplements the acoustic data.

**WHY**: Production planning, feed management, and health monitoring all depend on accurate biomass estimates. Standing manual sampling is expensive and disruptive; hydroacoustic non-contact survey is the candidate replacement, contingent on validation in pond conditions.

**HOW** — early state at migration:
- Methods documents from Infofish under `Proposal/`: `SamplingMethods-AquacutureBiomass-2026.docx`, `SamplingMethods-AquacutureBehaviour-2026.docx`, `BehaviorAnalysisMethod-Aquacuture-2026.docx`, `SurveyMethods-PondageMapping-2026.docx`. These are the V1.5 Jan-2026 statements of method from the vendor.
- Raw acquisition videos under `Data/Echoview videos/`.
- No reports yet — `Reports/` is empty.
- Vendor: Infofish Australia (BioSonics partner, ~30 yrs operating in AU recreational fishing & NRM).

## Git conventions

- Remote: none currently — local-only repo. Add later if needed.
- Main branch: `main`
- Commit messages: imperative tense.

## Documentation philosophy

Every fact has a single canonical home. Other documents link to it rather than restate it. **No orphans** — every document reachable from this file via a chain of links. CLAUDE.md indexes top-level directories; each top-level directory has a `README.md` that indexes its contents.

CLAUDE.md lists what exists and when to read it. Skills (`.claude/skills/`) wrap procedural workflows. Library (`glossary.md`, `docs/`, `analysis/`) carries declarative knowledge. For a research project the centre of gravity is `analysis/` and `docs/domain/`.

**Findings provenance.** Claims that land in `glossary.md`, `docs/domain/`, or `docs/adr/` link back to the `analysis/<dated>/INVESTIGATION.md` that produced them. Provenance is what keeps the substrate honest as the research evolves.

## Documentation map

### Synced surface (mirrors SharePoint)

- **`Articles/`** — external reference papers, related literature.
- **`Proposal/`** — grant and stage proposals; the project's "why" as written for stakeholders.
- **`Data/`** — raw and processed data. Date-range subdirs (e.g. `13-02-2026 to 26-02-2026/`) are the existing convention for time-series experiments.
- **`Reports/`** — interim and final reports (DOCX, PPTX, PDF) — the human-facing deliverables.
- **`Expenses/`** — finance / receipts.

### Library (also syncs to SharePoint, no shame in it)

- **`README.md`** — human-facing entry; links back to this file.
- **`glossary.md`** — domain ubiquitous language. Read before naming anything.
- **`analysis/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>/INVESTIGATION.md`** — investigations. **The primary work surface.** Each dated dir holds the scripts and the canonical writeup.
- **`analysis/analysis-landscape.md`** — narrative across all investigations.
- **`docs/domain/`** — non-vocabulary domain knowledge: model mechanics, data shape, known issues. Promoted from INVESTIGATION findings via `/finish-analysis`.
- **`docs/adr/`** — Architecture Decision Records (e.g. methodological choices). 3-of-3 admission test.
- **`docs/reference/`** — OPTIONAL. Used only if the project grows first-party utility code worth a module-level writeup.
- **`docs/planning/`** — open backlog (`future-work.md`) and the boundary rule vs. `.tickets/`.
- **`.tickets/`** — local issue tracker.
- **`.tickets/inbox/`** — incoming cross-repo tickets.

### Local only (excluded from sync)

- **`src/`, `scripts/`** — code.
- **`output/`** — generated artefacts (regeneratable).
- **`.git/`, `.venv/`, `.claude/`, `.env`, `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, `.rclone-filter`** — tooling and config.

## Skills

`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — procedural workflows. The most-used skills on a research project are `/start-analysis`, `/finish-analysis`, `/sharepoint-sync`, and `/finish` (which calls `/sharepoint-sync push` at the end). Symlink from `~/AgenticEngineering/skills/<name>` to install warehouse skills.
**Skills are warehouse-symlinked — do not edit them in place.** Every entry under `.claude/skills/` is an absolute symlink to `~/AgenticEngineering/skills/<name>/`. Editing the SKILL.md (or any file under the linked dir) writes through the symlink and propagates the change to **every other project** that links the same skill. A global `PreToolUse` hook (`~/.claude/hooks/check-symlink-target.sh`) blocks Edit/Write on any symlink whose target lies outside this project root and will surface the safe alternatives:

- **Project-local tweak**: replace the symlink with a copy first — `rm <link>; cp -rL ~/AgenticEngineering/skills/<name> .claude/skills/<name>` — then edit. The project now owns its fork; it will not receive future warehouse improvements to that skill.
- **New skill, this project only**: create a regular directory `.claude/skills/<my-skill>/` (no symlink). No collision.
- **Improvement that should reach every project**: `cd ~/AgenticEngineering/`, edit the canonical source, commit. All linked projects pick up the change automatically.

## What does NOT belong in CLAUDE.md

Methodology details (`docs/domain/` or the relevant INVESTIGATION). Step-by-step procedures (a skill or `docs/reference/`). Specific findings (the INVESTIGATION they came from, plus a glossary/domain promotion). Anything that applies only to some tasks.

## Update rules

When you change behaviour, update the doc that describes it. A task is not done until the docs match the state of the project.

- **Investigation completed** → finalise `analysis/<date>-<topic>/INVESTIGATION.md` and register it in `analysis/analysis-landscape.md`. Promote findings to `glossary.md` / `docs/domain/` / `docs/adr/` / `future-work.md` as applicable. (`/finish-analysis` does this.)
- **Methodology decision passing 3-of-3** → new `docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md`, with provenance link to the INVESTIGATION.
- **New domain term resolved** → add to `glossary.md`, with provenance link.
- **New domain mechanic discovered** → add to `docs/domain/`, with provenance link.
- **First-party utility code added** → write or extend a doc in `docs/reference/` (create the dir if absent).
- **New planned work** → `docs/planning/future-work.md`.
- **Project structure change** → update this file.
- **End of session** → `/finish` (which runs `/sharepoint-sync push` after orphan checks).

## No orphans

Every document reachable from this file via a chain of links. The `/finish` skill sweeps for orphans. Every analysis subdir must be linked from `analysis/analysis-landscape.md`.

## Portability

This file also satisfies AGENTS.md. Symlink `AGENTS.md` → `CLAUDE.md` if needed.
